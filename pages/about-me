# Welcome to the Johz blog

This site contains mutterings, rants, and hopefully the occasional mildly interesting or informative post, on a wide range of topics including computing, politics, and religion, interspersed with a bit of humour.

# Who is Johz?

I'm a physics student at the University of Manchester.  I love coding, and have been programming in Python for almost four years.  More recently, I've been looking at web technologies, and functional languages.  I'm around on [GitHub][github-johz], where a handful of my better projects are hosted.  (I should warn you that better is very much a relative term, but feel free to poke around there.)
