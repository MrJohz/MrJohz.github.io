    <p>My brother is a Special Snowflake.</p>
<p>Now before you complain (especially you, dear brother), please read this whole blog.  It may well get worse later on, but it will get better eventually.  Probably, at least.</p>
<p>The thing is, my brother has dyslexia.  How does he spell?  He doesn't.  That joke's funnier if you imagine I'm telling the one about the dog with no nose, but unfortunately still not very funny at all.  As a family, we've been aware that he's had dyslexia for a while now, and he has recieved support for it in many of his exams, but recently he's had an official assessment (a few hundred pound's worth of it, no less) and has been been given the official designation "dyslexic".  My brother is officially a Special Snowflake.</p>
<p>I honestly didn't realise I had a problem with this until I found myself listening to the story for the hundredth time.  My brother is not a fantastic story teller (although certainly better at it than I am - I continue to feel sorry for anyone who is forced out of courtesy to be entertained by the pair of us) and the story tends to go on for a bit, which allows me some alone time with my thoughts.  (At least when I'm not interupting him to destroy the story in my own special way.)  And I think I do have a problem here.</p>
<p>The issue is fundamentally with me (of course), and it lies in the fact that I like conformity.  I'm not a fan of special snowflakes.  There are certain limitations on this.  I mean, when it comes to opinion, I firmly disagree with everything that anyone popular says by default, because I am a grumpy old (almost 20!) man.  However, in most other things, I am very keen on everyone staying the same.  I don't go around being special, why should you?</p>
<p>And let's face it, this kind of thinking seems harmless.  Conforming to a societal norm is something that we as social animals are good at, and something that presumably aids our survival as a species, or at least did once upon a time.  It gives us those unwritten laws like "don't urinate in public" and "hitting people isn't nice, mkay?"  The advice that our urge for conformancy offers tends to be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn't always quite as helpful as we want.  Right now I am doing something that I regularly enjoy doing, which is procrastinating.  This particular piece of procrastination is about an email I need to write to my university to inform them that I need to take a few days off.  Why is this so hard for me?  Because it feels like I'm singling myself out as someone requiring different treatment.  Essentially, I would be someone who doesn't conform to societal norms - or at least the societal norms that I see around me.</p>
<p>I will resolve this issue momentarily - I really need to sort this email out tonight, and the threat of a deadline is a surefire way to motivate me - but it's still things like it that require a surprising amount of courage.  And this is simply to send an email the main point of which is to cover certain bases.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, let's examine my brother's case.  He had to speak to a member of staff at his college, face-to-face, and request a ~£300 exam.  Based on previous, more informal tests, he was well aware that the result of his talk would be something along the lines of permanent support throughout his education at the college.  As it turned out, he has a scribe who will take down notes for him, and write down his answers in exams.  Not only did he single himself out to the Powers That Be, but he also marked himself differently amongst his peers.  And my brother did this because he knew that if he worried more about fitting in with society's mould, he would be unable to do the course he wanted to do.</p>
<p>Of course, when there are higher stakes, we take bigger risks, but I feel like it really puts me to shame.  I worry about being the odd one out.  I struggle in conversations with friends who don't know the finer points of the etiquette of discourse.  I am "all things to all men" simply to fit in and be like everyone else.</p>
<p>You may notice that I've stayed away from some of the real battles against society's views, in the form of various civil rights campaigns that have taken place through the ages.  I certainly agree that we should be taking heart from the courage of those people, and I don't disagree that there are many issues that we need to face as a global society.  However, I'm not very good at being inspired by famous people, because I find it so easy to classify them as "superhumans", whose very feet I am not worthy to lick, if only because they'd probably have me arrested.  (Another societal norm you should be glad we have.)  My brother, on the other hand?  I can definitely assure you that he's not a superhuman, lovely though he may be, and that makes it a lot easier to learn from him when he does something awesome.</p>
<p>I guess the upshot of this is that I'm very proud of him.  I'd tell him this, but he'd stare at me blankly before hitting me, or stealing my seat in the car, or some other expression of the mutual bond of fraternal love and friendship that we share.  So instead, you all get to read this, which I'm sure had opened up your eyes considerably, or your money back.  And hopefully I'll be a bit bolder when it comes to doing things that don't necessarily fit in with my societal norms.</p>
