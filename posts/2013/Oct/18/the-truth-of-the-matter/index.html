  <div class="article">
    <p>You may have noticed something about my blog over the past few days, and that is that I have been lying.  Lying over the internet is truly one of the most heinous of crimes, and yet it has been committed right in front of your eyes.  And now I can only do the rightful thing and admit to the hideous falsity that I have&nbsp;constructed.</p>
<p>This site was not built with&nbsp;Octopress.</p>
<p>I can imagine your shock, but I hope you will at least grant me time to explain myself.  When I started putting together my new, exciting blog, I had originally planned for it to be a Wordpress blog.  I&#8217;d find some nice plugins, get myself a nice theme, and, hey presto, a beautiful, dynamic blog that would not only be simple to browse, but easy to edit and modify.  But then I actually got Wordpress, and somehow it didn&#8217;t feel right.  There wasn&#8217;t a nice syntax highlighting module, and the markdown abilities weren&#8217;t the impressive beasts that I have become accustomed to.  Additionally, it just lacked the customisability I wanted.  I guess if I knew <span class="caps">PHP</span> I&#8217;d be able to play a lot more with it, but in the end, I said no to&nbsp;Wordpress.</p>
<p>Of course, this lead me on a search through the wilderness to find Octopress, that bastion of cool, Ruby-esque hip-ness.  I got on relatively well with Octopress, despite the fact that it didn&#8217;t get on very well with me.  In the end, however, I was driven away by the fact that my posts were in some oddly-named folder hidden in a directory that I didn&#8217;t know or care about.  The tribulations of making an Octopress post eventually outweighed the power and cool nature of Octopress.  This, however, was the point that I left you at, the point at which I left you with the now-erroneous impression that I use&nbsp;Octopress.</p>
<p>What do I use now, then?  Well, I wanted something written in a language I could understand.  Ruby was good, but Python was better.  I liked the idea of a static blog, but I didn&#8217;t want to hunt down posts in odd folders, I wanted it to all look fairly obvious.  I wanted something that was simple enough that all I needed was a simple script to build, test, serve, and upload to my server, yet actually quite powerful underneath.  Thus, this blog is now hosted with <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>.</p>
<p>Pelican is quite cool.  It does most of the things that Jekyll/Octopress do, but with a very heavy emphasis on &#8220;articles&#8221; or blog posts.  Like Octopress, it provides a quickstart script that sets most of your default settings, and builds your Makefiles/Fabfiles for you.  It should be noted that, for me at least, the Fabfile is broken in ways that confuse me completely, but the Makefile has worked like a dream.  It&#8217;s based on markdown <em>and</em> reStructedText.  It comes with an array of themes and plugins.  It&#8217;s generally quite&nbsp;impressive.</p>
<p>Speaking of themes, you might have noticed that this blog has a new theme.  Sure, it should be obvious that getting new blogging software almost always precipitates getting a new theme, but this theme is special, because I built it.  Personally I am amazed.  I ask dearly that no-one who knows anything about web design look at the css files, as they are a hideous mess put together using less, random snippets from stackoverflow, and moments of frenzied inspiration.  I might minify them just so that people can&#8217;t see how bad my <span class="caps">CSS</span>-fu&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>However, it seems to work, both here on my laptop, and also on my all-important phone.  It&#8217;s pretty much all simple css, so it should run pretty quickly.  I have a vague plan to add extra colour-schemes, and then allow the user to select different themes, and then save preferences client-side, and all sorts of exciting things like that, but apart from that I&#8217;ve tried to limit my excitement for overly-complex javascript scripts to the random-quote generator at the top of the main page.  (Scroll up and refresh the page to see the exciting quotes!  I spent, like, thirty seconds on them!  They&#8217;re my best&nbsp;work!)</p>
<p>Anyway, to conclude: Welcome to what will almost certainly hopefully maybe my new blog!&nbsp;Perhaps.</p>
