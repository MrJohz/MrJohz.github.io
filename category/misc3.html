        <p>You may have noticed something about my blog over the past few days, and that is that I have been lying.  Lying over the internet is truly one of the most heinous of crimes, and yet it has been committed right in front of your eyes.  And now I can only do the rightful thing and admit to the hideous falsity that I have&nbsp;constructed.</p>
<p>This site was not built with&nbsp;Octopress.</p>
<p>I can imagine your shock, but I hope you will at least grant me time to explain myself.  When I started putting together my new, exciting blog, I had originally planned for it to be a Wordpress blog.  I&#8217;d find some nice plugins, get myself a nice theme, and, hey presto, a beautiful, dynamic blog that would not only be simple to browse, but easy to edit and modify.  But then I actually got Wordpress, and somehow it didn&#8217;t feel right.  There wasn&#8217;t a nice syntax highlighting module, and the markdown abilities weren&#8217;t the impressive beasts that I have become accustomed to.  Additionally, it just lacked the customisability I wanted.  I guess if I knew <span class="caps">PHP</span> I&#8217;d be able to play a lot more with it, but in the end, I said no to&nbsp;Wordpress.</p>
<p>Of course, this lead me on a search through the wilderness to find Octopress, that bastion of cool, Ruby-esque hip-ness.  I got on relatively well with Octopress, despite the fact that it didn&#8217;t get on very well with me.  In the end, however, I was driven away by the fact that my posts were in some oddly-named folder hidden in a directory that I didn&#8217;t know or care about.  The tribulations of making an Octopress post eventually outweighed the power and cool nature of Octopress.  This, however, was the point that I left you at, the point at which I left you with the now-erroneous impression that I use&nbsp;Octopress.</p>
<p>What do I use now, then?  Well, I wanted something written in a language I could understand.  Ruby was good, but Python was better.  I liked the idea of a static blog, but I didn&#8217;t want to hunt down posts in odd folders, I wanted it to all look fairly obvious.  I wanted something that was simple enough that all I needed was a simple script to build, test, serve, and upload to my server, yet actually quite powerful underneath.  Thus, this blog is now hosted with <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>.</p>
<p>Pelican is quite cool.  It does most of the things that Jekyll/Octopress do, but with a very heavy emphasis on &#8220;articles&#8221; or blog posts.  Like Octopress, it provides a quickstart script that sets most of your default settings, and builds your Makefiles/Fabfiles for you.  It should be noted that, for me at least, the Fabfile is broken in ways that confuse me completely, but the Makefile has worked like a dream.  It&#8217;s based on markdown <em>and</em> reStructedText.  It comes with an array of themes and plugins.  It&#8217;s generally quite&nbsp;impressive.</p>
<p>Speaking of themes, you might have noticed that this blog has a new theme.  Sure, it should be obvious that getting new blogging software almost always precipitates getting a new theme, but this theme is special, because I built it.  Personally I am amazed.  I ask dearly that no-one who knows anything about web design look at the css files, as they are a hideous mess put together using less, random snippets from stackoverflow, and moments of frenzied inspiration.  I might minify them just so that people can&#8217;t see how bad my <span class="caps">CSS</span>-fu&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>However, it seems to work, both here on my laptop, and also on my all-important phone.  It&#8217;s pretty much all simple css, so it should run pretty quickly.  I have a vague plan to add extra colour-schemes, and then allow the user to select different themes, and then save preferences client-side, and all sorts of exciting things like that, but apart from that I&#8217;ve tried to limit my excitement for overly-complex javascript scripts to the random-quote generator at the top of the main page.  (Scroll up and refresh the page to see the exciting quotes!  I spent, like, thirty seconds on them!  They&#8217;re my best&nbsp;work!)</p>
<p>Anyway, to conclude: Welcome to what will almost certainly hopefully maybe my new blog!&nbsp;Perhaps.</p>

      <div class="article-text">
        <p>Recently, I found Elixir.  It just appeared in front of me.  Specifically, <a href="http://learnxinyminutes.com/" title="Learn X in Y Minutes">Learn X in Y Minutes</a> appeared before me, and so I read.  About a quarter of the way down lay a link to a short page entitled &#8220;Elixir&#8221;.  This should have been a horrible language.  It was functional, and I have always been an object-oriented programmer before.  It was based on Erlang, a language with <a href="http://damienkatz.net/2008/03/what_sucks_abou.html" title="What Sucks About Erlang">syntax as bad as Lisp&#8217;s, but without the redeeming powers of Lisp</a>.  It had a syntax based on Ruby, which I hate<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.  All in all, I should have switched off&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t.  I carried on reading.  I found a handful of blog posts.  I started to read into Erlang and the <span class="caps">OTP</span>.  I found Elixir at the start of a week-long camping holiday.  By the end of the week, before I had had the chance to write a single line of code, I was hooked.  Why?  Well, I still don&#8217;t know, but I might as well try and explain my reasoning to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Firstly, Elixir is functional, and this is cool.  Sure, <span class="caps">OOP</span> is awesome, and I love it when it&#8217;s around, but functional programming has an elegence to it that just isn&#8217;t matched by building up big objects.  Indeed, there are many programs where object-oriented programming just doesn&#8217;t make much sense.  Take a module designed to read json.  In Python, the standard way would be to have a class, say the JSONDecoder class, and let that do all the work.  Indeed, in Python this is a remarkably sensible system.  The module&#8217;s user is normally presented with simple functions for most of their needs, but they can also subclass JSONDecoder whenever they need to, and add onto it as they please.  It&#8217;s how you&#8217;d do it in Python, but is it really how you do it&nbsp;conceptually?</p>
<p>My mental image of decoding <span class="caps">JSON</span> is definitely a function.  I give it <span class="caps">JSON</span> string input, and it comes out with a structure I can use in my code.  This function then needs to tokenise my input, which is a job for a function.  Each set of tokens needs to be recompiled back into a native data structure.  Each step is a function, taking an input, returning an output.  Decoding <span class="caps">JSON</span>, along with a large number of other tasks, is a functional&nbsp;task.</p>
<p>Sure, there are other tasks for which the object-oriented structure is perfect.  When I want to model a real-life object then it&#8217;s natural to have an object with attributes and methods, but knowing a functional language will definitely give you the tools to use when you need a different&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>Secondly, Elixir is Erlang, and this is powerful.  A brief history lesson that you should <a href="http://www.erlang.org/" title="The Erlang Homepage">follow</a> <a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/" title="Learn You Some Erlang (For Great Good)">up</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)" title="Erlang (programming language) - Wikipedia">on</a> because it&#8217;s so interesting:  Erlang was designed by Erricson, the Swedish telecommunications company, as a language that would be suitable for their telephony systems.  It needed to be able to fix itself when it broke, update itself without breaking, be able to handle concurrency with ease and, because programmers should be able to program efficiently, it was designed to be a functional program, on the basis that functional programming would be easier for the&nbsp;programmers.</p>
<p>Erlang is an amazingly nifty language because of these things.  While benchmarks are useless, <a href="https://gist.github.com/josevalim/1582864" title="Dynamo Benchmark">this one</a> demonstrates one of the benefits of an Erlang background.  It&#8217;s a test of various similar web frameworks, and it shows how the Elixir/Erlang-based one (Dynamo) is able to deal with concurrency straight out of the box.  As the writer<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> notes, the other options almost certainly support concurrency, but immediately, straight out of the box, and with such ease that it&#8217;s sometimes said that processes are an Erlang developer&#8217;s&nbsp;objects.</p>
<p>So Elixir builds on Erlang, and in a really nice way, too.  Leaving aside the syntax, which is by-and-large friendly and intuitive to use, there&#8217;s all sorts of extras.  Take the standard libraries.  Erlang libraries are useful, but woefully inconsistent.  Some use zero-indexing, others start their indexing at 1.  When performing operations on structures such as lists, some functions will put the structure as the first argument, others as the structure.  Elixir&#8217;s library is designed to standardise this.  Not only that, but when you do need an Erlang library, it&#8217;s as easily accessible as any Elixir library, just using a slightly different&nbsp;syntax.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Elixir isn&#8217;t Erlang, and this is a relief.  As I&#8217;ve just said, Erlang did make mistakes, but Elixir has done a brilliant job of avoiding them.  Just one small example: Elixir comes with dictionaries built-in, as a list of tuples that can be accessed using the near-univeraslly standard bracket notation.  It&#8217;s not all-powerful, but it&#8217;s damn&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p>Or take records, which are the missing link between simple mappings and full-blown objects.  When you want to know exactly what types of data you&#8217;re passing around, define yourself a record and use it.  Indeed, you can use it as if it were a built-in type by adding protocols, which allow for a very basic duck-typing system to form.  For a functional program, Elixir is very&nbsp;object-oriented.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s the most powerful part of Elixir, the fact that it is written, by-and-large, in itself, using macros.  If Erlang is as painful to write as Lisp without the benefits of using macros, then Elixir is as powerful as Lisp with all her macro-based glory, but with all of the benefits of a syntax you want to write in.  Macros are designed to be used for anything, ranging from simple domain-specific languages (imagine the <code>get "url/route" do</code> style used in Ruby-on-Rails or the task-specification format in a Rakefile) to directly adding your own constructs into the library.  One of the popular examples is the unit-testing system that&#8217;s been included.  A macro is able to examine the code that&#8217;s passed into it, allowing ExUnit to look at&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">test</span> <span class="s2">&quot;a simple assertion&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">assert</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And interpret it in such a way as to be able to respond like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">test</span> <span class="n">adding</span> <span class="n">two</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nc">MathTest</span><span class="p">)</span>
   <span class="o">**</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nc">ExUnit.ExpectationError</span><span class="p">)</span>
                <span class="ss">expected</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
     <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">equal</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
   <span class="n">at</span> <span class="n">test</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exs</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">7</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It&#8217;s not desperately showy or flashy, and you&#8217;d be forgiven for wondering why this example gets mentioned so much, but it&#8217;s actually a lot more involved than it seems.  The simple assertion macro is passed a length of code as a syntax tree, and it gets to evaluate it and understand it as it sees fit.  That&#8217;s&nbsp;powerful.</p>
<p>This has been but a brief look at Elixir, and I&#8217;d encourage you to try it out yourself sometime.  It&#8217;s a language built entirely for developers, right down to the extensive build-tools that come packaged with it from the off.  A good starting point would be the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html" title="Elixir - Getting Started">getting started guide</a> that you can see on the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/" title="Elixir Home">main website</a>.  Of course you should always peruse the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/master/" title="Elixir Docs">documentation</a>.  There aren&#8217;t many good tutorials on Elixir at the moment (it&#8217;s not even four years&#8217; old, and hasn&#8217;t currently done a 1.0 release) but I&#8217;d recommend <a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/" title="Learn You Some Erlang (For Great Good)">Learn You Some Erlang (For Great Good)</a> as a start, and, if you&#8217;re willing to splash the cash, the <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir" title="Programming Elixir - Pragmatic Programming">Pragmatic Programmers</a> are putting together a book, and you can buy the beta-edition ebook and learn as it gets continually&nbsp;updated.</p>

      <div class="article-text">
        <p>So I got a blog.  A second blog, to be precise.  Some of you might remember the <a href="http://johz.wordpress.com/" title="Johz Blog">old blog</a> on <a href="http://wordpress.com/" title="Wordpress Home">wordpress.com</a>.  You might also have noticed that I haven&#8217;t blogged from there in over a year.  I managed to tell you all that I&#8217;d arrived at University, and then I mysteriously went silent.  Well, now I&#8217;m back, back with a vengeance, and also with hosting.  Yes,&nbsp;hosting.</p>
<p>At the time that I write this, I am using <a href="http://www.webfaction.com" title="Web Faction Home">Web Faction</a> for my hosting.  Why?  Well, it seemed to me like it was the most helpful.  There were docs on doing pretty much everything I wanted to do, with a healthy support base, and a generally hacker-oriented vision.  That appealed to me.  Then I managed to find a <a href="http://slickdeals.net/f/5989592-webfaction-hosting-50-off-1yr-65-off-3yrs" title="Webfaction deals">code for 50% off hosting</a>, and it suddenly seemed like the most sensible choice.  It&#8217;s certainly not the cheapest provider out there, but I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll turn out to be a good first&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>More technical details abound.  I&#8217;m currently hosting in Europe, because Europeans are cooler and more awesome, and my internet connection is poor enough that I need all the help I can get in improving the latency of my ssh connection.  This blog is produced using <a href="http://www.octopress.org" title="Octopress Home">Octopress</a>, which is lovely, and allows me to use Markdown, which I just love.  I&#8217;m currently hunting down a nice theme for the blog, but I might have to end up making my own, and that would be bad.  No, seriously, it would be an affront to all your sensibilities, so if you&#8217;ve found an awesome theme, please tell me about it.  It could save your life, although I have yet to work out&nbsp;how.</p>
<p>What sorts of things will you find on here other than a blog?  Well, as I have returned to <a href="http://www.nationstates.net" title="NationStates Home">NationStates</a>, expect a few <span class="caps">NS</span>-related apps to appear.  Additionally, I&#8217;m planning on fixing up my <span class="caps">IRC</span> bot, K-Eight, and running him from this server.  Finally, I&#8217;d like to get back to writing.  You might have read my old poems and prose on the WordPress blog.  If you haven&#8217;t, please don&#8217;t go back and look at them, they were awful.  But I&#8217;ve got to confess, I really enjoyed being able to write, and a success in a short-story competition recently (well, half a year ago) and a few conversations with some creative friends have inspired me to try and revisit some of my old ideas.  So look out for that, maybe, if you&#8217;re masochistic&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Anyway, for now I&#8217;m going to go back to coding and thinking up new blog posts.  Again, if you know of a good Octopress theme, contact me somehow.  I&#8217;ll get comments and an email address up soon, until then I recommend telepathy, sending a message in a bottle, or simply contacting me on <span class="caps">IRC</span>: <a href="irc://irc.esper.net/johztestingchannel" title="#johztestingchannel on Esper.net">#johztestingchannel on Esper.net</a>.  Bye for&nbsp;now!</p>
