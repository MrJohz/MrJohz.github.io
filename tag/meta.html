        <p>I lied about the&nbsp;waffles.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;re actually going to get is me waffling on for a bit.  It&#8217;s almost the same thing, except not as edible, not very tasty, and it can&#8217;t be smothered in chocolate sauce.  Like I said, I completely lied about the waffles, I just couldn&#8217;t come up with a snappy sounding&nbsp;title.</p>
<p>So an update.  Update might be the wrong word, it&#8217;s more a sort of reflective moody thing, where I pretend I&#8217;ve regressed five years and am living in a pokey black-painted bedroom with heavy metal posters on all the walls and a general feeling of internal self-loathing.  That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m taking a second adolescence, on the principle that it works for politicians and second&nbsp;homes.</p>
<p>To talk about updates, I&#8217;d like to initially introduce my housemate, who we&#8217;ll call Elgar because I really wish I knew someone who was called Elgar.  Despite being about as good at programming as I am at most athletics-based sports, he has this magic ability to come in and debug my code for me, often while scarcely understanding what it is that I&#8217;m trying to do.  I like to call this the &#8220;new eyes syndrome&#8221;, because I&#8217;m in a pretentious mood.  To give you an example, I spent a good hour trying to work out a where a segfault was coming from in some C++ code, when he walked in, took one look at my code, and told me that I was using the wrong input file.  It&#8217;s a very helpful skill to have around as a coder, because when you get onto a particular coding path, you tend to forget the other ways of solving the problem.  Or at least that&#8217;s how it works for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Anyway, earlier this afternoon, Elgar walked in and debugged my life, which was a slightly unsettling experience.  I can&#8217;t quote you the exact words he said, because I have a memory like a sieve, but it was something along the lines of &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you coding&nbsp;anymore?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a very good question, Elgar.  Why am I not coding anymore?  Also, should &#8220;anymore&#8221; be &#8220;anymore&#8221;, or &#8220;any&nbsp;more&#8221;?</p>
<p>With respect to the former (the latter is as of yet unsolved, please send a postcard if you think you know the answer), I think it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve become a consumer, rather than a producer.  Most things operate on a simple principle: One person (or group of people) will produce, while other people (or person) will consume.  Take code.  I like to believe that most of my code is for an eventual consumer, who invevitable turns out to be either myself, or the hard drive as I forget all about the project and leave it rotting.  Or more generally, television is made by a producer (quite literally in this case, although a number of other people also take part in that role), and we as consumers consume&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I think I had a good grasp of the two sides of the story.  I consumed a handful of television shows, YouTube channels, comical blogs, and the Grand World of <span class="caps">IRC</span>, and I also enjoyed a bit of flash gaming on the side.  Yet I also wrote code and blog posts, and I actively took part in NationStates, which could be considered producing activity, but I&#8217;m really just shoehorning it in there to make this rough, overextended analogy work.  On top of this, once upon a time, I actually did&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>These days, I play Minecraft and watch&nbsp;videos.</p>
<p>So what is this update?  Well, this update is to say that I&#8217;ve started to begin to recognise this, and I&#8217;d like to get back to actually doing some producing now.  It also leads directly into the&nbsp;forecast.</p>
<p>First off in my grand forecast of things to come in the next few weeks/months/years/millenia, I need to poke around with my <span class="caps">WFE</span> archive system, which is a NationStates thing but may or may not have some quite cool stuff in it.  Secondly, as I said, I&#8217;ve been playing Minecraft, and the Exciting World of Modding has appeared before my eyes, and I am very tempted to start diving in, in no small part due to the fact that I really would like to get some java experience under my belt before I leave university, even if it is akin to drowning my eyeballs in vats of sulphur.  Thirdly, I want to blog more.  I was talking to someone on <span class="caps">IRC</span> about this recently, and it&#8217;s a really fun and helpful thing to do.  It gets you used to writing large amounts of stuff consistently.  It gets you used to thinking about things properly.  Essentially, go and get a blog.  That will solve all the world&#8217;s&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>I would like to briefly say something about my own circumstances.  Next week, if all goes to plan, I shall be donating my stem cells to someone with leukemia.  It&#8217;s quite scary, but it&#8217;s quite exciting.  I get to go down to London, which despite being a city-boy myself, is still extremely exciting.  It won&#8217;t be terribly painful, as these days most people donate via <span class="caps">PBSC</span>, which is essentially a prolongued blood donation, but where you get the blood back at about the same rate that you donate it.  I&#8217;d like to encourage you, my dear reader (that&#8217;s a very deliberate singular, there&#8217;s definitely only one of you, hello Mum!) to think about joining the registry.  Eventually, I&#8217;ll write up everything that happened to me, add a page on the blog, and offer round links to the bone marrow registry, but for now, here are two sites that you ought to explore:  <a href="http://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/bonemarrow/">The <span class="caps">UK</span> <span class="caps">NHS</span> site on bone marrow donation</a>, and the <a href="http://www.anthonynolan.org/">Anthony Nolan Foundation homepage</a>, Anthony Nolan being the organisation that I&#8217;m donating with.  I&#8217;d really recommend checking those out, because it&#8217;s one of those relatively small things you can do that will drastically improve - hell, let&#8217;s be blunt, the word here is <em>save</em> - someone&#8217;s life.  Anyway, that&#8217;s happening Monday &#8216;til Wednesday, depending on how everything works out, so wish me luck, and/or pray for&nbsp;me.</p>

        <p>The aim is that this will be my last post about my blog for a while, but I just wanted to point out some of the interesting features, because I think that&#8217;s what one does on technology-related blogs, and really I just want to fit in an be like the other cool guys.  Dammit, I&#8217;m a terrible&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, this is a <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> blog.  Excuse the mild ideosyncracies of the documentation (particularly that if you click on a link, you will <em>never</em> be able to get back to the main page), it&#8217;s actually quite a nice system.  Pelican is a static-site generator, in the style of all the other static-site generators that I&#8217;m sure we could name between us, but with a few nice touches of it&#8217;s own.  For example, unlike Jekyll and associated software, it only requires a directory of posts and pages, as opposed to a directory containing all the parts of a blog.  It&#8217;s relatively well supported, particularly among the French-speaking community.  It&#8217;s also written in Python, which, as a Pythonista first and foremost, means I can read the code and actually understand most of what it&#8217;s&nbsp;doing.</p>
<p>Secondly, you&#8217;ll notice the theme.  The theme is custom-built.  This is amazing.  My knowledge of <span class="caps">CSS</span> is approximately equal to my knowledge on the dietary habits of pregnant sperm whales.  Seriously, any good impressions you have of the styling of this site are more an indication of the power and ease-of-use of <a href="http://lesscss.org/">less</a> than my own ability.  Some interesting and exciting&nbsp;things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can change the colour-scheme!  I know a number of people who have really strong preferences over light vs dark, so if you scroll to the bottom, you&#8217;ll find a switcher that allows you to switch between light and dark.  Everything is entirely client-side, and the preference is saved in localStorage so your theme-choice will persist between sessions.  If you don&#8217;t have either localStorage, or javascript in general, the page will load the dark theme by default, because dark is clearly the cooler&nbsp;choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theme includes a random quote of the page load.  This is the second &#8216;bubble&#8217; that appears on the main page.  The quotes are taken from the <span class="caps">RANDOMQUOTES</span> pelican option, and then every time the page loads, a javascript function writes out a div containing a random quote.  Obviously, if there is no javascript, the div never gets written at all, and so the page still runs&nbsp;beautifully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theme is largely <span class="caps">XKCD</span>/1271 compliant.  For those that don&#8217;t obsessively follow the famous webcomic, <a href="http://xkcd.com/1271">comic #1271</a> recently described the habit of highlighting text while browsing websites, and then feeling good when the highlighted text makes a beautiful shape.  As someone who suffers from a similar compulsion (for reference, I consider option 4 of Randall&#8217;s list to be the only viable option) I spent last night redesigning parts of the article layout so that when one highlights text in Chrome, there are no longer any horrible&nbsp;overhangs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are still a few things that I haven&#8217;t quite sorted, that I still need to work on.  I&#8217;ve only really been concentrating on the index template and the pages template, so it might be that other pages look slightly more broken.  When I get comments, you can tell me about those pages.  Although first I really need to get a comments system in&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>The theme is open source, obviously, and is available <a href="https://github.com/MrJohz/pillbox-theme">on GitHub</a> as the Pillbox theme.  Feel free to fork&nbsp;away.</p>

        <p>You may have noticed something about my blog over the past few days, and that is that I have been lying.  Lying over the internet is truly one of the most heinous of crimes, and yet it has been committed right in front of your eyes.  And now I can only do the rightful thing and admit to the hideous falsity that I have&nbsp;constructed.</p>
<p>This site was not built with&nbsp;Octopress.</p>
<p>I can imagine your shock, but I hope you will at least grant me time to explain myself.  When I started putting together my new, exciting blog, I had originally planned for it to be a Wordpress blog.  I&#8217;d find some nice plugins, get myself a nice theme, and, hey presto, a beautiful, dynamic blog that would not only be simple to browse, but easy to edit and modify.  But then I actually got Wordpress, and somehow it didn&#8217;t feel right.  There wasn&#8217;t a nice syntax highlighting module, and the markdown abilities weren&#8217;t the impressive beasts that I have become accustomed to.  Additionally, it just lacked the customisability I wanted.  I guess if I knew <span class="caps">PHP</span> I&#8217;d be able to play a lot more with it, but in the end, I said no to&nbsp;Wordpress.</p>
<p>Of course, this lead me on a search through the wilderness to find Octopress, that bastion of cool, Ruby-esque hip-ness.  I got on relatively well with Octopress, despite the fact that it didn&#8217;t get on very well with me.  In the end, however, I was driven away by the fact that my posts were in some oddly-named folder hidden in a directory that I didn&#8217;t know or care about.  The tribulations of making an Octopress post eventually outweighed the power and cool nature of Octopress.  This, however, was the point that I left you at, the point at which I left you with the now-erroneous impression that I use&nbsp;Octopress.</p>
<p>What do I use now, then?  Well, I wanted something written in a language I could understand.  Ruby was good, but Python was better.  I liked the idea of a static blog, but I didn&#8217;t want to hunt down posts in odd folders, I wanted it to all look fairly obvious.  I wanted something that was simple enough that all I needed was a simple script to build, test, serve, and upload to my server, yet actually quite powerful underneath.  Thus, this blog is now hosted with <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>.</p>
<p>Pelican is quite cool.  It does most of the things that Jekyll/Octopress do, but with a very heavy emphasis on &#8220;articles&#8221; or blog posts.  Like Octopress, it provides a quickstart script that sets most of your default settings, and builds your Makefiles/Fabfiles for you.  It should be noted that, for me at least, the Fabfile is broken in ways that confuse me completely, but the Makefile has worked like a dream.  It&#8217;s based on markdown <em>and</em> reStructedText.  It comes with an array of themes and plugins.  It&#8217;s generally quite&nbsp;impressive.</p>
<p>Speaking of themes, you might have noticed that this blog has a new theme.  Sure, it should be obvious that getting new blogging software almost always precipitates getting a new theme, but this theme is special, because I built it.  Personally I am amazed.  I ask dearly that no-one who knows anything about web design look at the css files, as they are a hideous mess put together using less, random snippets from stackoverflow, and moments of frenzied inspiration.  I might minify them just so that people can&#8217;t see how bad my <span class="caps">CSS</span>-fu&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>However, it seems to work, both here on my laptop, and also on my all-important phone.  It&#8217;s pretty much all simple css, so it should run pretty quickly.  I have a vague plan to add extra colour-schemes, and then allow the user to select different themes, and then save preferences client-side, and all sorts of exciting things like that, but apart from that I&#8217;ve tried to limit my excitement for overly-complex javascript scripts to the random-quote generator at the top of the main page.  (Scroll up and refresh the page to see the exciting quotes!  I spent, like, thirty seconds on them!  They&#8217;re my best&nbsp;work!)</p>
<p>Anyway, to conclude: Welcome to what will almost certainly hopefully maybe my new blog!&nbsp;Perhaps.</p>

      <div class="article-text">
        <p>So I got a blog.  A second blog, to be precise.  Some of you might remember the <a href="http://johz.wordpress.com/" title="Johz Blog">old blog</a> on <a href="http://wordpress.com/" title="Wordpress Home">wordpress.com</a>.  You might also have noticed that I haven&#8217;t blogged from there in over a year.  I managed to tell you all that I&#8217;d arrived at University, and then I mysteriously went silent.  Well, now I&#8217;m back, back with a vengeance, and also with hosting.  Yes,&nbsp;hosting.</p>
<p>At the time that I write this, I am using <a href="http://www.webfaction.com" title="Web Faction Home">Web Faction</a> for my hosting.  Why?  Well, it seemed to me like it was the most helpful.  There were docs on doing pretty much everything I wanted to do, with a healthy support base, and a generally hacker-oriented vision.  That appealed to me.  Then I managed to find a <a href="http://slickdeals.net/f/5989592-webfaction-hosting-50-off-1yr-65-off-3yrs" title="Webfaction deals">code for 50% off hosting</a>, and it suddenly seemed like the most sensible choice.  It&#8217;s certainly not the cheapest provider out there, but I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;ll turn out to be a good first&nbsp;choice.</p>
<p>More technical details abound.  I&#8217;m currently hosting in Europe, because Europeans are cooler and more awesome, and my internet connection is poor enough that I need all the help I can get in improving the latency of my ssh connection.  This blog is produced using <a href="http://www.octopress.org" title="Octopress Home">Octopress</a>, which is lovely, and allows me to use Markdown, which I just love.  I&#8217;m currently hunting down a nice theme for the blog, but I might have to end up making my own, and that would be bad.  No, seriously, it would be an affront to all your sensibilities, so if you&#8217;ve found an awesome theme, please tell me about it.  It could save your life, although I have yet to work out&nbsp;how.</p>
<p>What sorts of things will you find on here other than a blog?  Well, as I have returned to <a href="http://www.nationstates.net" title="NationStates Home">NationStates</a>, expect a few <span class="caps">NS</span>-related apps to appear.  Additionally, I&#8217;m planning on fixing up my <span class="caps">IRC</span> bot, K-Eight, and running him from this server.  Finally, I&#8217;d like to get back to writing.  You might have read my old poems and prose on the WordPress blog.  If you haven&#8217;t, please don&#8217;t go back and look at them, they were awful.  But I&#8217;ve got to confess, I really enjoyed being able to write, and a success in a short-story competition recently (well, half a year ago) and a few conversations with some creative friends have inspired me to try and revisit some of my old ideas.  So look out for that, maybe, if you&#8217;re masochistic&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Anyway, for now I&#8217;m going to go back to coding and thinking up new blog posts.  Again, if you know of a good Octopress theme, contact me somehow.  I&#8217;ll get comments and an email address up soon, until then I recommend telepathy, sending a message in a bottle, or simply contacting me on <span class="caps">IRC</span>: <a href="irc://irc.esper.net/johztestingchannel" title="#johztestingchannel on Esper.net">#johztestingchannel on Esper.net</a>.  Bye for&nbsp;now!</p>
