  <div class="article">
    <p>I use the <a href="http://fishshell.com/">fish shell</a> as my go-to shell.  It&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s colourful, it&#8217;s full of features, and I&#8217;d highly recommend it.  One of those features is a shell-completion mechanism in the form of the <code>complete</code> command.  Now many other shells have completion, but for now I&#8217;m just going to play with the fish version, and then see if I can apply it to other shells later on, perhaps in a future&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in shell completions because I got bored the other day and started learning <a href="http://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, and now I&#8217;m trying to build a program that, given an input definition, will output a shell script to define the shell completions for that input.  Yesterday I got to the point that I could just about comprehend the Rust part (if in doubt, stick another &#8220;<code>&amp;</code>&#8221; in front of it<sup id="fnref:rust-advice"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:rust-advice" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>), and realised that actually the new difficulty was that I didn&#8217;t really know how to do shell&nbsp;completion.</p>
<h2>First steps - just&nbsp;options</h2>
<p>The best place to start is with a program to define the completions for.  Starting as simple as possible, here&#8217;s one defined in a sort-of-docopt-y&nbsp;form.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>USAGE:
    my-favourite-program [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -a, --all               Do all the favourite things
    -u                      Only use unsigned integers
    -w, -weird              Weird &quot;old-style&quot; option
</pre></div>


<p>Only options, but three different kinds.  There&#8217;s short options (<code>-x</code>), long options (<code>--long-opt</code>) and also weird single-dashed long options that fish calls &#8220;old-style&#8221;.  The example given in the fish shell docs is <code>-Wall</code>, but then I&#8217;ve always understood that to be &#8220;-W, with the argument &#8216;all&#8217;&#8221;.  Regardless, how do you complete this different&nbsp;options?</p>
<p>The full signature of a program can&#8217;t be given in one single definition, instead each option is given separately.  The <code>complete</code> command starts by defining what command the completion applies to using the <code>--command</code> option.  This is followed by all of the alternatives for each option, using the <code>--short-option</code> flag for short options, the <code>--long-option</code> flag for long options, and the <code>--old-option</code> flag for old options.  Finally, an optional description can be attached using the <code>--description</code> flag.</p>
<p>The order of the flags passed to <code>complete</code> don&#8217;t actually matter as far as I can tell, but doing it in the same order each time makes it much easier to read the command, so I&#8217;ll do it that way.  All in all, that means the completion file might look something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">complete</span> --command <span class="s1">&#39;my-favourite-program&#39;</span> --short-option <span class="s1">&#39;a&#39;</span> --long-option <span class="s1">&#39;all&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --description <span class="s1">&#39;Do all the favourite things&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">complete</span> --command <span class="s1">&#39;my-favourite-program&#39;</span> --short-option <span class="s1">&#39;u&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --description <span class="s1">&#39;Only use unsigned integers&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">complete</span> --command <span class="s1">&#39;my-favourite-program&#39;</span> --short-option <span class="s1">&#39;w&#39;</span> --old-option <span class="s1">&#39;weird&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --description <span class="s1">&#39;Weird &quot;old-style&quot; option&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To test that this works, run those commands in a fish shell, then type <code>my-favourite-program -&lt;tab&gt;</code>.  You should get something that looks a bit like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">$ my-favourite-program -</span>
<span class="go">--all  (Do all the favourite things)  -u  (Only use unsigned integers)  -weird  (Weird &quot;old-style&quot; option)</span>
<span class="go">-a     (Do all the favourite things)  -w    (Weird &quot;old-style&quot; option)</span>
<span class="go">$ my-favourite-program -weird</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Arguments</h2>
<p>This is all okay, but it&#8217;s a bit boring.  Many options require an argument of some kind.  How does that&nbsp;work?</p>
<p>Fish has a couple of different switches here.  Firstly, option arguments can be specified using the <code>--arguments</code> option.  <code>--arguments</code> takes a single parameter that takes &#8220;a space-separated list of possible option-arguments, which may contain&nbsp;subshells&#8221;.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also some extra switches that specify particulars about how the argument should be treated.  For example, the <code>--require-parameter</code> switch tells fish that a particular argument must have an argument.  This means, among other things, that it can&#8217;t be used in the middle of a set of short options.  For example, given a command with options <code>-a -b -c</code> where <code>-b</code> has a required parameter, fish shell knows that <code>-ac</code> can still be followed by another option, but that <code>-ab</code> cannot be followed by the <code>-c</code> option, it will be followed by an&nbsp;argument.</p>
<p>Additionally, by default fish will assume that the files in the current directory can always be passed as arguments to the current option.  To prevent this, the <code>--no-files</code> switch can be passed.  <code>--no-files</code> can be combined with <code>--require-parameter</code> using the <code>--exclusive</code> switch.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to the original program definition, change it so some of the commands take arguments, and try to fill those arguments&nbsp;in.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>USAGE:
    my-favourite-program [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -f, --file FILE         Include FILE in program
    -x, --extra on|off      Turns extra on or off
    -c, --command COMMAND   The cargo command to execute beforehand
</pre></div>


<p>Okay, so this program is getting more and more contrived.  I&#8217;ve added a few different options to play with to try out different&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>The <code>--file</code> option is probably the easiest one to start with.  It takes any file - that&#8217;s fish&#8217;s default anyway.  It is also a required parameter, so the <code>--require-parameter</code> option can be added in.  This is what it looks&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">complete</span> --command <span class="s1">&#39;my-favourite-program&#39;</span> --short-option <span class="s1">&#39;f&#39;</span> --long-option <span class="s1">&#39;file&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --require-parameter <span class="se">\</span>
    --description <span class="s1">&#39;Include FILE in program&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The second option, <code>--extra</code> is also fairly simple.  It takes either &#8216;on&#8217; or &#8216;off&#8217; and nothing else.  As there&#8217;s a required option, and files aren&#8217;t allowed, this deserves the <code>--exclusive</code> switch, as well as the argument&nbsp;specification.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">complete</span> --command <span class="s1">&#39;my-favourite-program&#39;</span> --short-option <span class="s1">&#39;x&#39;</span> --long-option <span class="s1">&#39;extra&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --exclusive --arguments <span class="s1">&#39;on off&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --description <span class="s1">&#39;Turns extra on or off&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You can try both of those fairly easily, although the first one doesn&#8217;t really do all that much.  The last option, <code>--command</code>, is the most interesting.  It takes a cargo command.  This could be produced by manually typing out all the different cargo commands, but dammit this is the future, and if we aren&#8217;t allowed hoverboards and ray-guns we might as well use what we have&nbsp;got.</p>
<p>What we have is subshells.  Interestingly, in fish, subshells aren&#8217;t expanded inside strings as one might expect, which means that the <code>complete</code> command can use them to define short functions that list the available arguments dynamically.  This particular feature isn&#8217;t necessarily all that useful for listing cargo commands, as those commands are unlikely to change very often, but it is pretty neat and comes in handy&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>
<p>To get a list of cargo commands, I&#8217;ve used <code>cargo --list</code>, removed all of the spaces, and cut off the first line.  It probably isn&#8217;t the most efficient, but it&nbsp;works.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">complete</span> --command <span class="s1">&#39;my-favourite-program&#39;</span> --short-option <span class="s1">&#39;c&#39;</span> --long-option <span class="s1">&#39;command&#39;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --exclusive --arguments <span class="s2">&quot;(cargo --list | tr -d &#39; &#39; | sed &#39;1d&#39;)&quot;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --description <span class="s1">&#39;The cargo command to execute beforehand&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
